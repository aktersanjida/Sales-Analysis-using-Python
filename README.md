## Introduction
This project aims to provide insights into the Diwali sales data. While taking inspiration from Rishabh Mishra's analysis, this project extends the scope by adding components such as customer retention analysis and detailed sales and order analysis.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this analysis is available on [Rishabh Mishra's GitHub repository](https://github.com/rishabhnmishra/Python_Diwali_Sales_Analysis/blob/main/Diwali%20Sales%20Data.csv).

## Features
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Customer Segmentation
- Product Analysis
- Sales and Order Analysis
- Customer Retention Analysis

## Analysis Components

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Performed a thorough EDA to understand the distribution and trends in the data. This includes visualizing sales over time, geographical sales distribution, and customer demographics.

### 2. Customer Segmentation
Segmented customers based on gender, age group, occupation, purchase behaviour, state and marital status. This helps in identifying key customer groups and tailoring marketing strategies accordingly.

### 3. Product Analysis
Analyzed product performance to understand which products are the most popular based on their amount of order frequency and which are profitable.

### 4. Sales and Order Analysis
Conducted a detailed analysis of sales and orders to identify  peaks and patterns. This includes:
- Average Order Value

### 5. Customer Retention Analysis
Added a component to analyze customer retention. This involves:
- Calculating repeated Customers
- Customer Lifetime Value(CLY)

## Results
The analysis provides valuable insights into Diwali sales patterns, customer behaviour, and product performance. The additional components of sales, order, and customer retention analysis offer deeper insights into strategic decision-making.
